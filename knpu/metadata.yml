title:  Go Pro with Doctrine Queries
summary: |
    
    You already know how to query with SQL, so learning how to do complex
    queries with Doctrine shoudl *not* give you a headache. In this series,
    we'll learn the language Doctrine speaks (DQL), as well as the query
    builder object, how to use complex query features and even how to run
    good ol' fashioned raw SQL queries with Doctrine. Because hey, sometimes
    simplicity rules :).
